.SH NAME
install \- install binaries
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B install
[
.B \-c|\-d
] [
.B \-m
mode ] [
.B \-o
owner ] [
.B \-g
group ] [
.B \-s
] file1 file2; or file1 ... fileN directory
.SH DESCRIPTION
The file(s) are copied (or moved if the \fB-d\fP option is specified)
to the target file or directory.  If the destination is a directory, then
the \fIfile\fP is moved into \fIdirectory\fP with its original file-name.
If the target file already exists, it is replaced.
.PP
The \fB-c\fP option is present for compatibility only; it has no
effect.  However, you may not specify both \fB-c\fP and \fB-d\fP at
the same time.
.PP
The mode is set to 755; the \fB-m\fP option may be used to specify
an alternate mode.
.PP
The \fB-o\fP and \fB-g\fP options may be used to specify an owner
and/or group, respectively.
.PP
The \fB-s\fP option causes the file to be stripped.  If the file
cannot be stripped, it will still be installed.
.PP
\fIInstall\fP refuses to move a file onto itself.
.PP
Installing ``/dev/null'' creates an empty file.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Upon successful completion a value of 0 is returned.  Otherwise, a
value of 1 is returned.
